<h1>Volunteers Needed for Preserving Fire Website</h1>
<p>Gustav Mahler â€” 'Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.'</p>
<br>
<p>Mission Statement: (coming soon) PreservingFire is a website centered on promiting the classics as liberal arts education
  in the family and personal study. It is a home site for social media pages that shares daily quotes from the classics 
  in order to promote western culture through the classics.
  
  This is a low cost, part time, high impact effort to build interest in grass roots self education in the liberal arts based on classic literature.
  We are in need of (unpaid) technical collaborators that have skills in graphics arts, web design and social media savvy.
